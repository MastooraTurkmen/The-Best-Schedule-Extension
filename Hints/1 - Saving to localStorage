All that you need to save to local storage is the state object itself. Don't overthink the fact that it's a state value â€” in and of itself, it's just a JS object like any other, and it can be saved to localStorage like any other! You can do this in much the same way as you would in vanilla JavaScript! 

If you're wondering about how or whether you should save to local storage via useEffect, consider reading the React documentation on this: https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect
